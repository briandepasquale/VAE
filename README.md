# VAE
Some experiments with VAEs and tensorflow in Julia

VAE_julia.ipynb is a working VAE in Julia and MNIST_MLP.ipynb is a working MLP in Julia. VAE.jl is the relevant Julia module for the VAE. All other files are tests, etc. that I was playing with.

Remaining question for me: what is the relationship in Version in Project.TOML file and git "tag" verion (and how it relates to documents)?
